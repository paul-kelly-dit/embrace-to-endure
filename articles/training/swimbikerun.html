            <h4  class="mb-5">Triathlon is not 3 sports! It&rsquo;s one sport &ndash; SWIMBIKERUN</h4>
            <p>When training for triathlon, athletes usually make the mistake of seeing it as 3 different sports. They assume they need to train for swimming like swimmers, bike like cyclists and run like runners. Instead they should be looking to save energy on the swim, reducing aerobic taxing and neuromuscular firing on the bike and teaching your body how to run on fatigued legs on tight muscles and reduced range of motion.</p>

            <p>The average triathlete swims around 2-3 times a week &ndash; roughly 1.5k to 2k. This swim training volume does not give the athlete, enough time in the water to fully develop the skills as a swimmer.</p>

            <p>Why it is CRITICAL for athletes to think of triathlon training NOT as 3 separate sports&#8230;but as swimbikerun&#8230;.and why saving energy on the swim, reducing aerobic taxing and neuromuscular firing on the bike and teaching your body how to run on fatigued legs on tight muscles and reduced range of motion is triathlon!</p>

            <p>Swimming for triathlon: Unskilled swimmers uses way more energy to cover the same distance as a skilled swimmer, therefore they need to swim LESS volume but more frequently. Unskilled swimmers should not swim longer sets (3 x 500m) until they develop their skills. Swimming longer sets will not be as productive to the unskilled athlete as their stroke will fall apart after 100m or so. Doing lots of 25s and 50s are ideal with the correct form and under load. Unskilled swimmers should use equipment like pull buoy and paddles to aid with body position and to reduce aerobic taxing, also they help the athlete to develop a better stroke.</p>

            <p>Cycling for triathlon:</p>

            <p>Cycling is the least skilled sport of all three and for triathlon it is more about strength than skills. The focus for cycling is about developing strength and lactate tolerance. Most age group athletes have limited time to train on the bike, usually 2 or 3 times per week, so it&rsquo;s important to make each session count! In triathlon, the bike is all about arriving at the start of the run in control, without having accumulated overt amounts of aerobic fatigue, having worked the legs in a way that accommodates cycling fatigue without generating run fatigue. It is from this &ldquo;don&rsquo;t tax the run muscles&rdquo; perspective that you can best understand how triathlon cycling is not the same as the sport of cycling.</p>

            <p>The price of higher cadence is higher aerobic stress and hence also greater glycogen consumption. As a triathlete, you are training to run after the cycling portion. Attempting to run with a more forceful, longer stride rate in a triathlon will quickly lead to disappointment &ndash; the tired legs have nothing left to give. A triathlete needs to increase running stride rate to preserve the run muscles. For 70.3 / Ironman, the cadence should be around 70-80 rpm. The longer the distance, the lower the speed/power so your muscle can tolerate a lower cadence due to less muscle force/contraction. Also and very importantly, If you ride at a lower cadence during a triathlon, you will not fatigue your neuromuscular system as much (each rpm requires a muscle firing command by your neuromuscular system), saving it for when it is needed most! At the end of an ironman run where we want to keep that 180+ cadence.</p>

            <p>Lower cadence cycling: &ndash; Saves neuromuscular system (&ldquo;Firing&rdquo;) to be used on the run &ndash; Lowers heart rate due to the slow contractions and high resistance &ndash; Consequently conserves glycogen stores important fuel need on any endurance event</p>

            <p>Running for triathlon:</p>

            <p>Running in triathlon is totally different than pure road racing. Athletes have, in their legs, a limited range of motion that is caused by tight and overused muscles (the hip flexors, hamstrings, quads, etc). This limited range of motion will prevent you from bringing your legs as high during the recovery phase and from bringing your knee as high during the propulsion phase. Therefore, the stride length gets shorter and you&rsquo;ll run slower.</p>

            <p>Note to self, over winter months I&rsquo;m going to try and do yoga twice a week to work on mobility and muscle elasticity, something we lose with age. Most of us spend a lot of time seating either on the car or at work and it causes all muscles on the &ldquo;front &rdquo; of out body to get shorter (tighter) while we get the muscles on the &ldquo;back&rdquo; of our body weaker and &ldquo;stretched&rdquo;.</p>

            <p>The efficiency in triathlon running comes from the ability of running fast on fatigued and tight legs. To be able to do this, you need to develop a running style that is more like a &ldquo;shuffle running&rdquo;, where you&rsquo;ll focus on a higher turnover to overcome the shortening in your stride.</p>

            <p>High cadence running becomes even more important during long distance races like the Ironman, in which the distance will add an extra level of fatigue on your legs, thereby reducing your stride length even more. By running with a lower stride rate, your second half of the marathon will be much slower or even turn to a walk. Remember the longer the time you spend on the ground (lower stride rate) the higher is the muscle fatigue.</p>

            <p>A lot of practice is needed to develop a high stride rate running style as your body at first is not used to the new neuromuscular pattern of firing your muscles so quickly. Also running at a high stride rate will increase your heart rate and aerobic taxing. As a result, this running style would work better if you have saved these components on the bike. Now you can appreciate the benefits of riding at lower cadence on the bike.</p>

            <p>In summary:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Swim: Focus on developing strength in the water. The more you train this way, the more prepared you&rsquo;ll be to race fast in open water swims. </li>
                <li>Bike: Low cadence cycling means lower heart rate and higher efficiency. Practice big gear riding to get you ready for race day. </li>
                <li>Run: High stride rate running leads to less fatigued legs and more efficient triathlon running.</li>
            </ul>
